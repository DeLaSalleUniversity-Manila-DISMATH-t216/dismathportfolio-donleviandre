#WEEK 1

* This week, during the first day we were introduced to a different kind of mathematics, discrete mathematics.

* We Were introduced to some terms in this course and that this course doesn''t use numbers rather it uses logic and proof.

* We try an exercise on proving, which was the "knight and the knave".

* The exercise basically prepared us to what we should expect on this course.

* This week I also learned to identify a proposition and i was also introduced with logical connectives.

* After the explanation of the logical connectives, we were introduced to the truth table for Conjunction, Disjunction, Exclusive Disjunction, Conditional and Biconditional

#WEEK 2

* This week we were introduced to logical equivalences that can used in simplifying a proposition.

* We were introduced to different laws these were: Identity Law, domination law, negation law, double negation law, idempotent law, commutative law, associative law, distibutive law, de morgan's law and the absorption law.

* After that we were introduced to rules of inference, namely: Modus ponens, Modus tollens, Hypothetical syllogism, Disjunctive syllogism, Addition, Simplication, Conjunction and Resolution	these are used to test the validty of the arguements given.

* I also learned about Existential Quantifiers which is only true for some values and Universal Quantifiers which is always true for any possible values.

#WEEK 3

* This week we were introduces to the diffrent methods of proof.

* The diffrent methods were: Direct proof, indirect proof, proof by contradiction, proof by contraposition, vacuous proof and trivial proof.

* I understand the explanation of the methods, but for me the tricky part is when to use such method, and i think i need to study about this more.

#WEEK 4

* This week we were also introduced to mathematical induction. it is a "mathematical proof technique, most commonly used to establish a given statement for all natural numbers, although it can be used to prove statements about any well-ordered set. It is a form of direct proof, and it is done in two steps. The first step, known as the base case, is to prove the given statement for the first natural number. The second step, known as the inductive step, is to prove that the given statement for any one natural number implies the given statement for the next natural number. From these two steps, mathematical induction is the rule from which we infer that the given statement is established for all natural numbers". -wikipedia

* We were also introduced with a new topic called recursive algorithm, it is defined as an algorithm that solves a problem by reducing it to an instance of the same problem with smaller input.

* It was also this week that we were refreshed to some topics like summation.

#WEEK 5

* This week we were introduced again to Recursive Algorithm and Program correctness

* we were also introduced with program correctness cause it is included in the first exam.

* i learned tht in order to for the program to be correct we need to prove that the program always gives the correct output. wee ned to verify the program using two steps, 1. Show Partial Correctness of program and 2. Show that program always terminates.

*  i also learned about hoare triple that we can use it prove if the program is true.

* i also learned that there are also rules of inference for program correctness, namely, Composition rule, conditional statement and if-else statement.

*  Zeno's Paradox and the Power Series were also introduced this week.

* Sets were introduced also this week.

* i laso learned the set operations or relationship between sets which are: Union,Intersection,Set Difference and,Symetric Difference.

#WEEK 6

* This week we were still on sets but a new term was introduced to us which was the cardinality, it is the the number of elements in a set or other grouping, as a property of that grouping.

* functions are introduced this week, A Function assigns to each element of a set, exactly one element of a related set 

* with functions we were taught how to identify the domain and codomain of a function.

* we were also taught of the Different types of Functions, namely, One-To-One Function, Onto Function , and Bijection.

* One-To-One Function; If and only if f(a)=f(b) implies that a=b for all a and b in the domain of f.

* Onto Function; If the range and domain are equal and that every member of the codomain is the image of some elementof the domain.

* Bijection; If it is both one-to-one and onto.

#WEEK 7

* NO CLASSES

#WEEK 8

* we discussed about algoruthms which is a finite set of precise instructions for performing a computation or for solving a problem.

* in algorithm the imporatance of input and output was introduced.

* we were also taught on how to get the index of a certain element; and there are two ways to do that the linear search and the binary search.

* linear search is Locating an item in a list by examining the sequence of list elements one at a time, starting at the beginning.

* binary search: 
  - The algorithm begins by comparing the target with the middle element.
  - If the middle element is strictly lower than the target, then the search proceeds with the upper half of the list.
  - Otherwise, the search proceeds with the lower half of the list (including the middle)
  - Repeat this process until we have a list of size 1.
  - If target is equal to the single element in the list, then the position is
returned.
  - Otherwise, -1 is returned to indicate that the element was not found
  
* greedy algorithm was also introduced to us it is used when problems minimize or maximize some parameter over all possible inputs

* and we were also introduced into how to sort number using bubble search and insertion sort

* bubble sort has the concept that the bigger the number it will float higher like a bubble while insertion sort is placing in order and inserting the element into the already sorted part of the set.

#WEEK 9

* after last weeks discussion about searching lagorithms this week we were introduced to a new topic about sorting algorithms.

* sorting algorithms are algorithms that sorts the given inputs by its value or sorting the ouputs by increasingly. It like alphabetizing words.

* there are two main sorting algorithms introduced to us: bubble sort and insertion sort
  - bubble sort is comparing one element to each of the other element. It is called bubble sort because it got its concept from bubbles; the larger bubble or the element with the largest value will float up and the least will remain at the bottom.
  - insertion sort compares a new element to an initial element and if it is greater it will be placed after otherwise before.

* This week we were also introduced with greedy algorithms.

* Greedy algorithms
