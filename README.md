#WEEK 1

This week, during the first day we were introduced to a different kind of mathematics, discrete mathematics.

We Were introduced to some terms in this course and that this course doesn''t use numbers rather it uses logic and proof.

We try an exercise on proving, which was the "knight and the knave".

The exercise basically prepared us to what we should expect on this course.

This week I also learned to identify a proposition and i was also introduced with logical connectives.

After the explanation of the logical connectives, we were introduced to the truth table for Conjunction, Disjunction, Exclusive Disjunction, Conditional and Biconditional

#WEEK 2

This week we were introduced to logical equivalences that can used in simplifying a proposition.

We were introduced to different laws these were: Identity Law, domination law, negation law, double negation law, idempotent law, commutative law, associative law, distibutive law, de morgan's law and the absorption law.

After that we were introduced to rules of inference, namely: Modus ponens, Modus tollens, Hypothetical syllogism, Disjunctive syllogism, Addition, Simplication, Conjunction and Resolution	these are used to test the validty of the arguements given.

I also learned about Existential Quantifiers which is only true for some values and Universal Quantifiers which is always true for any possible values.
