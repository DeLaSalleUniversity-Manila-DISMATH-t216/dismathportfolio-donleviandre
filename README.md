#WEEK 1
This week, during the first day we were introduced to a different kind of mathematics, discrete mathematics.

We Were introduced to some terms in this course and that this course doesn''t use numbers rather it uses logic and proof.

We try an exercise on proving, which was the "knight and the knave".

The exercise basically prepared us to what we should expect on this course.

This week I also learned to identify a proposition and i was also introduced with logical connectives.

After the explanation of the logical connectives, we were introduced to the truth table for Conjunction, Disjunction, Exclusive Disjunction, Conditional and Biconditional
