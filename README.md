#WEEK 1

This week, during the first day we were introduced to a different kind of mathematics, discrete mathematics.

We Were introduced to some terms in this course and that this course doesn''t use numbers rather it uses logic and proof.

We try an exercise on proving, which was the "knight and the knave".

The exercise basically prepared us to what we should expect on this course.

This week I also learned to identify a proposition and i was also introduced with logical connectives.

After the explanation of the logical connectives, we were introduced to the truth table for Conjunction, Disjunction, Exclusive Disjunction, Conditional and Biconditional

#WEEK 2

This week we were introduced to logical equivalences that can used in simplifying a proposition.

We were introduced to different laws these were: Identity Law, domination law, negation law, double negation law, idempotent law, commutative law, associative law, distibutive law, de morgan's law and the absorption law.

After that we were introduced to rules of inference, namely: Modus ponens, Modus tollens, Hypothetical syllogism, Disjunctive syllogism, Addition, Simplication, Conjunction and Resolution	these are used to test the validty of the arguements given.

I also learned about Existential Quantifiers which is only true for some values and Universal Quantifiers which is always true for any possible values.

#WEEK 3

This week we were introduces to the diffrent methods of proof.

The diffrent methods were: Direct proof, indirect proof, proof by contradiction, proof by contraposition, vacuous proof and trivial proof.

I understand the explanation of the methods, but for me the tricky part is when to use such method, and i think i need to study about this more.

#WEEK 4

This week we were also introduced to mathematical induction. it is a "mathematical proof technique, most commonly used to establish a given statement for all natural numbers, although it can be used to prove statements about any well-ordered set. It is a form of direct proof, and it is done in two steps. The first step, known as the base case, is to prove the given statement for the first natural number. The second step, known as the inductive step, is to prove that the given statement for any one natural number implies the given statement for the next natural number. From these two steps, mathematical induction is the rule from which we infer that the given statement is established for all natural numbers". -wikipedia

We were also introduced with a new topic called recursive algorithm, it is defined as an algorithm that solves a problem by reducing it to an instance of the same problem with smaller input.

It was also this week that we were refreshed to some topics like summation.
